# Bunk-Mate

Many of us have desired to take a day off from college for various activities or simply to relax, but often refrain due to concerns about meeting the attendance requirement percentage. The Bunk Mate app/website aims to address this dilemma by providing a convenient solution for tracking classes attended and offering live updates on the remaining classes needed to meet the attendance target.
## Installation

Just download the latest ~[release apk](https://github.com/Bunk-Mate/Mobile-App/releases/latest/download/app-release.apk)~ and install!
## Usage

Here's how you can utilize the Attendance Tracker app effectively:

**1** **Create an Account**: Sign up for an account within the app.

**2** **Login**: Log in to your account that you just created.

**3** **Add Timetable**: The app will now prompt you to enter your timetable details. Provide details such as timetable name, start and end dates, and the required attendance percentage.
	* You also have the option of selecting a timetable shared by other users
 
**4** **Manage Timetable**: Once your timetable is added, navigate to the courses page from the navigation bar to view and manage your courses and their schedules.

**5** **Update Attendance Status**: Update your attendance status on the status page. **Single-click to mark a day as bunked, double-click to mark as skipped, and deep-press to mark as present**. By default, days are marked as present, meaning that you only need to update it if you bunk a class or if it is skipped.
